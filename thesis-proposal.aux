\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {9}{\ignorespaces A simulation run with medium confidence in predicting the number of unspotted characters in a word. The chart is drawn so one can observe the progress of spotting as well as transcription, each category indicating the portion of words which have the given percent of their characters recognized by spottings (or indicating the portion of words transcribed). One will note that a large number of words never have more than 20\% of their characters spotted. This is due to two reasons: we are only using the 100 most frequent bigrams, and many of words in the corpus are numbers, which we are not spotting or transcribing in this simulation. The group of words which are between 40\% and 60\% spotted which are never transcribed are either out-of-vocabulary as well or are simply diabolic cases which have too many possible transcriptions given the limited number of bigrams we can spot. An example of this diabolic case is the words ``suffice.'' The only bigrams we spot that are present in the word are ``ic'' and ``ce'' and the number of seven letter words ending in ``ice'' is 26 for our lexicon, thus this word would never be ``transcribed'' in the simulation.\relax }}{13}{figure.caption.9}}
